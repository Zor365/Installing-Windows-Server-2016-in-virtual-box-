<h1>Step 2: Create a New Virtual Machine</h1>

<h2>Name your machine:</h2>
You are at liberty to call it ‘windows server 2016 ’ and it should automatically change the version to windows 2016 64-bit, so make sure that's highlighted if it didn't automatically do it.

Recommended to have at least 2GB of Base Memory. You could increase if your system has more resources.
