Step 2: Create a New Virtual Machine
If you haven’t downloaded and installed virtual box, I have created a guide here  on how to go about it. Open Virtual-box and click on ‘New’ to create a new virtual machine.


Name your machine:
You are at liberty to call it ‘windows server 2016 ’ and it should automatically change the version to windows 2016 64-bit, so make sure that's highlighted if it didn't automatically do it.



Create a Virtual Hard-disk:
Recommended to have at least 2GB of Base Memory. You could increase if your system has more resources.


Cycle through and complete by clicking Finish to create your virtual machine.





Configure VM settings:
Next go to the Virtual Machine ‘settings’ go to the storage tab, empty disk, locating where you downloaded server 2016 ISO and get it inserted. Then click OK.







Step 3: Start up the virtual machine



Setting Up Windows Server 2016:
It loads a blue boot screen then the setup screen
Pick the language, time and keyboard formats as you need, hit next then hit install now




It will ask which version to pick. Pick the ones with desktop experience, choose the server 2016 standard with desktop experience and hit next 


Agree with the license terms, hit next

Type of install, choose custom


Make sure the drive is selected, hit next


It will go through the install and when done, let it restart. Click nothing as it boots-up into the setup, let it finish



Set up password for the administrator account. 

>input>keyboard>insert ctrl, alt, delete to unlock


Enter the password as it logs in the account for the first time


Then finally the desktop will load up
